title: London Perl Workshop 2017
---

This year I have been able to attend the [London Perl Workshop](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/).

These are my impressions:

### The organization

The organizers have done an spectacular job, everything was impeccable: the place, the schedule, the coffee breaks, the community bakes, the pre and post meetings, etc. So I would like say thank you again to everybody involved: the organizers, the volunteers, the speakers and the sponsors. It was perfect, really!

### The talks

Those were the talks I attended that I found remarkable:

* [‎Web automation with WWW::Mechanize::Chrome](https://corion.net/talks/WWW-Mechanize-Chrome/www-mechanize-chrome.en.html) by Corion: It seems Mozilla has decided to limit what Firefox add-ons can do making some of them as the [MozRepl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/) used to control Firefox from the outside unworkable and that has broken [WWW::Mechanize::Firefox](https://metacpan.org/release/WWW-Mechanize-Firefox) (also from Corion and which I have been happily using for a long time). Fortunately, Corion has stepped up again and created [WWW::Mechanize::Chrome](https://metacpan.org/release/WWW-Mechanize-Chrome) replacing the Firefox dependency by Chrome (or Chromium). The talk went into the fine details of using the module showing the audience its full potential and I found it pretty interesting. Thanks Corion!

* [‎Devel::MAT updated](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7243) by Paul Evans: The author showed us the recent improvements he has done on [Devel::Mat](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::MAT), a Perl module for memory usage tracing and debugging. I was impressed! The care Paul has taken to make it friendly and useful to others. Next time I have to debug some memory related problem I know where to look. Thanks Paul!

* [GraphQL in Perl: The Story So Far](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7250) by Ed J: GraphQL seems to be the future for Web Services and Ed J showed us how his module [GraphQL](https://metacpan.org/pod/GraphQL) can be used to support it from Perl. Again, that project looks like a big effort, both conceptually and at the implementation level and it looks quite promising!

* [An introduction to Rust](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7267) by Mark Sta Ana: This was an interesting talk that started which a very brief introduction to Rust and ended showing us how to call Rust code from Perl. It just reminded me that I must go into learning Rust in deep.

* [Debian Tips and Tricks‎](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7262) by Lacey Powers: I have been using Debian (and some of its derivatives) for more than two decades and still I didn't know about most of the tricks showed by Lacey (and they were for solving common problems). So, thanks Lacey!

### My talk

I gave my own talk about [Win32::Packer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::Packer), a module for packing Perl applications for Windows. I went directly for a live demo, leaving enough time for Q&A afterwards, something I have already successfully tried at the [Barcelona Perl&Friends](http://friends.barcelona.pm/2017/) workshop a couple of weeks before. I was not sure how easy would be for me to do it using my rusty English, but at the end I believe everything went well, there were lots of questions and several attendees approached me later to say they have liked it.

Getting my talks to be more interactive is something I have consistently being doing lately. Instead of following a stack of slides monotonously as I used to do, now, I try to include links to web pages which I follow freely, show and/or edit code and run it live, and also let the attendees ask questions and influence what I am talking about. I known it is much riskier, and that it may not work well for every subject or talk, but so far, it has been positive for me and I think people enjoys my talks better that way.

### In summary

It was a great event, with interesting talks and I really enjoyed it!

Again, thanks to all who make it happen!!!
